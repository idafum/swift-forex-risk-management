# Swift Risk Management
## Overview
In forex trading, risk management is often touted as the the cornerstone of success.

This challenge is compounded by the time-sensitive nature of market execution and lack of proper tools for lot size calculation during limit order setups.

The Swift Risk Management Calculator (SRMC) aims to bridge this gap by providing traders with a simple, effective,
and data-driven solution to manage risk and optimize their trading decisions.
